Balboa is a partner dance that originated in the Balboa Peninsula in Southern California during the 1920s and 1930s. It's a swing dance that was developed in response to crowded dance floors where dancers needed a more compact and efficient style that would allow them to navigate the limited space without colliding with others.

Balboa has experienced periods of popularity and revival over the years and continues to be danced by enthusiasts around the world who appreciate its elegance, musicality, and connection between partners. It's often taught and practiced in swing dance communities and events.
